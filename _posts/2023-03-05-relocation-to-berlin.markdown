**Summary**

About 5 months back, on 10th October 2022, I moved to [**Berlin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) for a new job. I am an Indian and a software engineer by profession.

**A little background**

Before this move I never travelled abroad. Just like most of the people on the planet I too always had this desire of living abroad and exploring new cultures. I started my first full time job in June 2017 and somewhere in the mid of 2018 I started wishing about moving abroad but it was not a consistent desire and was more of an infatuation so I never really explored this possibility in detail. I was working with a startup at that time and was based out of [**Hyderabad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad).

**Fast forward to April 2022**

I was happily working as a backend engineer with the search team at [**Zomato**](https://zomato.com). I was based out of [**Gwalior**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwalior), my hometown. It had already been more than two years since I moved back with my family because of the pandemic. At that time I had just recovered from some serious health issues and had already realized that life is too short and waiting for the right time made no sense. Suddenly, all of the procastination went away.

For the next 2 months I went through the general tech recuitment process at multiple companies and was able to get job offers from a couple of European companies. For relocation I had to choose one location out of Berlin (Germany), Warsaw (Poland) and Tallinn (Estonia). This is because one of the companies offered two options for relocation.

After considering a lot of factors I ended up joining the Adtech team at [**Delivery Hero**](https://deliveryhero.com) in Berlin. I started remotely from India on 1st September 2022 because of some delay in the visa process and a month later moved to Berlin.

**Today**

It has been more than 6 months now and it has been a great ride both on and off work. Hope the streak continues.
