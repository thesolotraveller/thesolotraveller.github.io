**Note**

I originally published this note around 4 months back, over LinkedIn. Here is the [**link to the LinkedIn post**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mohitguptajs_sahay-club-activity-6885622208044109824-HrOe?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web). Reposting it here.

**Post**

Back in September 2020 I came up with this idea of building a solution that focuses on helping people **resolve any blocker / issues by talking to a domain expert over 1:1 video call**. The idea was to solve only for problems which can be solved by speaking with someone virtually. 

I wrapped up the application development by the end of December 2020 and made the product live as a beta web app in the first week of Jan'21. I **named it Sahay** which mean help in hindi.

I didn't get to see mass usage of the product but saw some real transactions. Getting that notification for the very first transaction was blissful.

Listing down a few numbers below:

- **_Users Registered_**: 91
- **_Net Revenue_**: INR 18000
- **_Net Profit_**: INR 0 (Plan was to keep 0% commission till decent traction)
- **_Monthly cost of the cloud provider services_**: < INR 5
- **_Annual cost to keep the system running_**: ~ INR 3000 (domain, email mostly)

Though there is hardly any cost to keep the system up and running I am thinking about whether to keep it live or just bring the system down. Even though there was not much success I have some learnings to share. Listing the down below:

1. As far as the infra cost of launching a tech product is concerned, there is hardly any these days. Besides buying a domain, I have been paying less than INR 5 / month to keep the system up and running. Of course I would have loved to pay more had there been more traction.

2. After making it live as a beta product, I stopped pushing to get more users and feedback after a month or so and since then it has been running on auto pilot. This was a big miss.

3. I worked on this as an indie hacker. That worked till the product was to be made live but I guess teaming up with someone (with business / marketing expertise) right from the start would have been a better choice.

**Update**

After carefully thinking on a good friend's suggestion of not taking down the system for some more time, I decided to keep it running.
